# Car Price Prediction

##### Hi, 
###### Welcome to this repository! The objective of this repository is to bestunserstand linear regression. The data used in this repo has been taken from Kaggle (link below).

## Prologue


### About project Mechanic of Machine Learning:
I am a mechanical engineer by educaion. Now, I want to deep dive in the world of Machine Learning. I have taken up this project to understand the in-depth mathematics involved in regularly used ML algorithms. Under this project, I will be sharing useful material and links as I explore this domain.The objective is to learn and spread the same. Stay tuned to my git for updates!

### Business Case: 
A top manufacturer of automobiles has realized the need to provide real time cost estimates to consumers when configuring their car through their website. Build an ML based model to facilitate this requirement
### Notebook objectives:

* To understand and implement linear regression 
* To visualize and understand the data
* To select features which can best predict costs based on attribute-value pair. 
* To derive conclusions from the data and suggest solutions for business.
