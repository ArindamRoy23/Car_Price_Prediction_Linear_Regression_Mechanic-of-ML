# Emplyee_Firing_Linbear_Regression

This is a project to predict the employees who are vulnerable to getting sacked. I have used the dataset of IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &amp; Performance available on kaggle. I will be exploring linear regression using this dataset. In this repository, you can also find useful notes and links to understand linear regression better. The core learning tool for me is Andrew Ng's CS229 lecture available on youtube.
